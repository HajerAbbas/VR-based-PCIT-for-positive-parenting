# VR-based-PCIT-for-positive-parenting
 Concept &amp; research project for VR app enhancing Positive Parenting via Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT).

# Overview
This repository serves as a concept and research project for the development of a Virtual Reality (VR) application that aims to enhance Positive Parenting through Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). While the project does not currently contain any code or implementation, it represents a forward-thinking research initiative with the potential to positively impact parenting practices and child development.

# Project Goals
The primary objective of this research project is to explore the use of VR technology as a tool to improve the effectiveness of PCIT, a well-established and evidence-based intervention for enhancing parent-child relationships. Specifically, the project aims to:

<br>Investigate Feasibility: Assess the feasibility of integrating VR technology into PCIT sessions, evaluating its potential benefits and challenges.

<br>Enhance Engagement: Explore how VR can enhance parent-child engagement and interaction during therapy sessions.

<br>Improve Skill Acquisition: Investigate whether VR-based scenarios can facilitate the acquisition of positive parenting skills, such as communication, discipline, and emotional regulation.

<br>Research Publication: Develop a research paper summarizing findings, insights, and recommendations based on the project's outcomes.

# Repository Contents
This repository contains the following components:

<br>Project Proposal: A detailed project proposal outlining the research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.

<br>Literature Review: A compilation of relevant research papers, studies, and articles related to VR in parenting interventions and PCIT.

<br>Research Paper (Future): A research paper summarizing the project's findings and insights once the research has been conducted.

<br>Documentation: Any documentation related to the research methodology, data collection, and analysis.

# Contribution
While there is no code or implementation in this repository at the moment, we anticipate adding implementation details as soon as the research progresses. Contributions and collaborations from researchers, experts in child psychology, VR developers, and others interested in the intersection of technology and positive parenting are welcome. Contributions may include insights, suggestions, or collaborations on research activities related to VR-based PCIT.
