## Introduction:

Disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) in children can have long-term negative consequences if left unaddressed. This project explores the potential of virtual reality (VR) technology to provide an effective and accessible intervention for parents and children dealing with DBD.

## Features:

- **VR Environment:** Immersive virtual reality environment for parent-child interactions.
- **Interactive Training:** Parents can engage in interactive training sessions with a virtual child-avatar to practice positive parenting skills.
- **Realistic Scenarios:** Simulated scenarios allow parents to navigate challenging situations commonly encountered in parenting.
- **Feedback System:** Visual and auditory feedback are provided to reinforce positive behaviors and guide improvement.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Natural language processing (NLP) models utilized for dialogue conversation training of the virtual child-avatar.
- **Progress Tracking:** System tracks user progress and provides performance reports for continuous improvement.

## System Requirements:

- Virtual Reality (VR) headset compatible with Unity development environment
- Unity 3D development platform (version X.X.X)
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for voice recognition (optional)
- Additional hardware and software requirements as outlined in [System Requirements](#system-requirements) section of the project documentation.
